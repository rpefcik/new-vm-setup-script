### How to use
1. copy the script (`vm_setup.sh`) to your home directory
2. execute it by running the command
   ```bash   
   bash vm_setup.sh
   ```
3. choose which components should be installed by pressing `y` or `n` when prompted
4. insert your credentials when prompted
5. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: disconnect and reconnect to the vm when the script run is finished, so you user will be added to group `docker`. Otherwise, you will not be able to use docker
